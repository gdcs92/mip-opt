# Scheduling Problems
Scheduling problems are also multi-period problems. What makes them special 
(and challenging) is that there are typically events that must happen in a 
specific sequence. Therefore, some people also call them *sequencing problems*.

For example, in machine scheduling, we may want to decide when to start 
manufacturing each item and for how long to make it; in sports scheduling, 
it's more about deciding when and where each event takes place; and in nurse 
scheduling, we need to determine when each staff starts and ends their 
shift.

In some cases, it's appropriate to **discretize** the time horizon into time 
slots and assign events to them. For example, suppose that football matches can 
take place on Wednesday, Saturday, or Sunday over the next following three 
months and each team must play two away and two home games. This can be 
modeled as an assignment of teams to matches and matches to days using 
binary decision variables.

In some other cases, it's more appropriate to use **continuous** decision 
variables that determine the start time and duration of each event. For 
example, an electric power generator may be turned on at 10:23, turned off at 
11:45, turned on again at 1:12, and turned off at 1:56.

Let's get some practice starting with the 
[Voltwise](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/voltwise) use case. 

## Unit Commitment Problem (UCP)
Production of electric power is a challenging yet very important 
optimization problem that is solved daily across the globe. It's all about 
scheduling the production of a set of electrical generators to match energy 
demand at a minimum cost. 

Different from most commodities, electric power can't be stored very 
efficiently. Therefore, all generators must work synchronously to 
accurately match the expected demand as it fluctuates over time.

In addition, there may be multiple types of generators, each with 
different operational requirements and associated costs.

For example, turning on or off certain types of generators can be a very 
expensive process and may require multiple time periods. Additionally, 
switching off a generator may only be allowed after it's operating power for a 
minimum number of time periods.

The most basic version of this problem goes like this:
- There is a set of electric power generators;
- There is a set of discrete time periods, for example, a day decomposed 
  into 30-minutes time slots;
- Demand for electricity in each time slot is known and assumed deterministic;
- If a generator is turned on in a period, its output (in MW) must be between 
  given lower and upper bounds, both non-zero quantity;
- There is a production cost (dollar/MW) associated with each generator;
- There are a startup and shutdown costs associated with each generator;
- Once a generator is turned on/turned off, there is a minimum number of 
  periods that the generator mush be on/off before it can be turned 
  off/turned on again;
- Production of a generator must not ramp up (ramp down) too rapidly when it's 
  starting up (shutting down) or when it's on for two consecutive time periods.

The goal is to prescribe the most cost-efficient schedule that meets the 
demand on each period without violating any operational constraints.

A tighter formulation (that defines the production decision variables with a 
shift, see [[2]][2]) and its corresponding implementation are here:
