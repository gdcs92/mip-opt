# Solving Integer Programs
Different methodologies have been developed for solving mixed-integer programs 
(MIP). Branch-and-bound, Decision Trees, and Constraint Programming are 
among the most popular ones and each of these methodologies takes a combination 
of techniques.

At the core of the Branch-and-Bound algorithm, for instance, is the Simplex 
Algorithm, which is performed at every node of the searching tree in 
combination with cutting planes generation and heuristics that seek 
feasible solutions.

The [branch_and_bound](docs/branch_and_bound.odp) slide deck provides some 
insight on the dynamic of the algorithm from a geometric perspective.

In the next section, we will study the Simplex Algorithm.
