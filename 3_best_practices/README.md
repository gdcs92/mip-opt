# Best Practices
Professional programmers often talk about the importance of following best 
practices when writing code. Best practices are also critical when solving 
practical optimization problems, and they must start even before the coding
phase.

This module exists to help you to adopt best practices from the beginning.

If you want to learn best practices beyond the scope of optimization, make 
sure to check out the [Mip-Go](https://github.com/mipwise/mip-go) repository.

In the next section, we show you why and how to build data agnostic 
solutions, i.e., that can be used repeatedly with multiple data instances.
